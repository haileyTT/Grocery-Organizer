# My Personal Project:

## Grocery Organizer

With *Grocery Organizer*, users can create items with given quantity, aisle and price. Users can add and remove items,
and find the quantity, aisle and price of the item with a given name. Entering an aisle number gives a list of items in
the aisle. Users can also view all the items currently on their list to keep track of what they added and removed.
People who shop in grocery stores or employees who sort items in grocery stores will use this application. This project
interests me because it makes it easier for either customers or employers in grocery stores to locate items, and also
view the information of an item.

I would add more exception handling to make the program more robust. I would also separate some classes out of the 
GUI class to improve cohesion.
